properly on feature level and scenario level as per other cucumber variants.

1.0.1+1
=======
* Introduced this changelog.

1.0.1
=======
* Upgraded all dependencies.
* Minimal required Dart SDK is now 2.0.0.
* Removed log4dart because it is not dart2 compatible. Replaced it with the logging lib from pub.dart.

1.0.0
=======
* The fork removed all future-code and replaced it with async/await. The reason for that is that it can properly be used in dart2 tests.
